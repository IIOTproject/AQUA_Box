## Background
Flooding is the most common natural disaster occurring 43% of the world's total natural disasters from 1995-2015 [2]. As the global precipitation anomaly continues to rise in recent years, flood related incidents is becoming more common and its impact is greater for the global economy. In 2018 alone, 17.44 billion USD of economic damages was reported[1]. The highest ever recorded was in 2011 with 70.76 billion USD. 



Around the world, flooding affects 2.3 billion people, which is 56% of the world's population. Highly affected countries include USA, China, Philippines and India.

A study by Hirabayashi et al. [3] predict that as a warmer climate persists in fewer years from now, Asia's and Africa's flood risk would increase. This not only includes in areas near the sea but as well as inland.

## Sensors

### G1&2″ Water Flow Sensor  DN15 
Water flow sensor consists of a plastic valve body, a water rotor, and a hall-effect sensor. When water flows through the rotor, rotor rolls. Its speed changes with different rate of flow. The hall-effect sensor outputs the corresponding pulse signal. This one is suitable to detect flow in water dispenser or coffee machine. We have a comprehensive line of water flow sensors in different diameters. Check them out to find the one that meets your need most.
