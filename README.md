# AQUA_Box
Description
Water flow sensor consists of a plastic valve body, a water rotor, and a hall-effect sensor. When water flows through the rotor, rotor rolls. Its speed changes with different rate of flow. The hall-effect sensor outputs the corresponding pulse signal. This one is suitable to detect flow in water dispenser or coffee machine. We have a comprehensive line of water flow sensors in different diameters. Check them out to find the one that meets your need most.
